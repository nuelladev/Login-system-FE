# Simple Login System for Spring Boot with JWT

## Overview
This project is a simple login system frontend designed to integrate with a Spring Boot backend using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. It aims to provide a secure method of authenticating users by issuing a token upon login, which can then be used to access protected routes and resources on the server.

## Features
- **User Registration**: New users can sign up by providing their email, username, and password.
- **User Login**: Registered users can log in using their username and password.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Aesthetics**: The login system features an animated, aesthetically pleasing design with a "glassmorphism" effect.

## Current Status
The project is currently under construction. The frontend design has been implemented and includes form validation as well as animations. The next steps involve integrating the frontend with the backend API for JWT authentication.

## How to Use
To use this login system, clone the repository to your local machine and open the `login.html` file in a web browser. Please note that the backend API must be running and accessible for the system to function fully.
